on
accurate
floating-point
summation
the
accumulation
of
floating-point
sums
is
considered
on
a
computer
which
performs
t-digit
base
b
floating-point
addition
with
exponents
in
the
range
m
to
m
an
algorithm
is
given
for
accurately
summing
n
t-digit
floating-point
numbers
each
of
these
n
numbers
is
split
into
q
parts
forming
qn
t-digit
floating-point
numbers
each
of
these
is
then
added
to
the
appropriate
one
of
n
auxiliary
t-digit
accumulators
finally
the
accumulators
are
added
together
to
yield
the
computed
sum
in
all
qn
t-digit
floating-point
additions
are
performed
under
usual
conditions
the
relative
error
in
the
computed
sum
is
at
most
t
v
b
1-t
for
some
v
further
with
an
additional
q
t-digit
additions
the
computed
sum
can
be
corrected
to
full
t-digit
accuracy
for
example
for
the
ibm
b
t
m
m
typical
values
for
q
and
n
are
q
and
n
in
this
case
becomes
n
32
and
we
have
t
