eigenvectors
of
a
2
x
2
matrix
it
has
been
known
that
the
eigenvalues
of
a
certain
2
x
2
matrix
can
be
obtained
by
use
of
two
smaller
matrices
of
order
n
which
can
be
easily
constructed
an
algorithm
is
given
to
obtain
the
eigenvectors
of
the
2
x
2
matrix
by
use
of
the
eigenvectors
of
the
smaller
matrices
