a
final
solution
to
the
dangling
else
of
algol
60
and
related
languages
the
dangling
else
problem
consists
of
a
class
of
potential
ambiguities
in
algol-like
conditional
statements
whose
basic
form
is
if
b
then
if
b
then
s
else
s
where
b
and
b
are
boolean
expressions
and
s
and
s
are
basic
statements
the
difficulty
lies
in
whether
to
attach
the
else
to
the
first
if
or
to
the
second
one
existing
solutions
to
the
problem
are
either
ambiguous
or
unnecessarily
restrictive
let
sand
s
be
statements
we
define
s
to
be
closed
if
s
else
s
is
not
a
statement
and
to
be
open
if
s
else
s
is
a
statement
thus
an
unconditional
statement
is
a
closed
statement
open
and
closed
conditional
statements
are
defined
by
syntax
equations
in
such
a
way
as
to
preserve
openness
and
closure
in
each
case
an
else
must
always
be
preceded
by
a
closed
statement
it
is
shown
that
the
syntax
equations
are
unambiguous
and
that
may
change
in
the
statement
types
required
within
the
syntax
equations
would
lead
to
either
ambiguity
or
unnecessary
restriction
